The long overdue summary of how things went with cycling across the Moroccan desert: it was hot and 
so, so dry.

It turns out, we were woefully underprepared for this trek.  For starters it's amazingly dry there. 
In Ouarzazate we started in has 18% humidity.  Here in Minneapolis, at it lowest, will be 49% - an 
enormous perceived difference.  

As a result, we needed easily three liters of water each during the ride.  That first day, we had just 
two.  I was so dried out at the end of the day that I was wiping salt from my face and drank a liter 
of water with it barely wetting my tongue. All this after just 39km - our short day. 

Needless to say, I was pretty ready to give up that night.  

We did spend the night at a pretty nice (though isolated) [kasbah][1]. 
Dinner was included, the beds were reasonably comfortable, and the shower was somewhat hot.  I slept like 
a rock and felt very refreshed in the morning.  I still felt like we wouldn't make it, but I was at least 
feeling as though we could give it a go. 

Armed with three liters each this time, plus some [hydration tablets][2] 
(granted we used one late the first day, but this time we would use them from the start), we set out for a 
50 km -minimum day. 

With the better water supply and an early start, as well as more regimented stops for drinking said water and reapplying 
sunscreen, progress was far easier. The early morning sun was far less menacing. We had a one large hill but otherwise the terrain we passed was flat and 
mostly devoid of trees.  Patchy desert grasses, grazed upon by the occasionial sheep herd, was all we saw for
kilometers.

Still, it wasn't an eventless day.  One of our party had a flat just around noon.  We happened to find a 
shelter (a taxi shelter, perhaps) to provide a little shade in order to fix it.  Our pump line for the [Presta 
valve][4] leaked like crazy, so we decide to pull of the tire and replace with one of the spares.  Turns out, 
all the spares were [Shrader valve][3] tires - a bit of a mismatch for the rim.  

Given that we were out in the middle of the desert, with miles to go, a bit of jury-rigging was in order.  
A multi-tool pliers and file made quick work of the rim, and the wheel was converted from Presta to Shrader 
in no time.  Back on the road.
