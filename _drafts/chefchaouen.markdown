With Tangier already a memory, we sped on to Chefchaouen.  This city is a great stopping point on the way to Fez.  Nestled in the mountains, it features a hilly, but very walkable Medina.  What makes it more unique is the sky blue paints used to color the town. The color creates a town that feels both beautiful and in inviting.
