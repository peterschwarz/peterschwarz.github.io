A bit about the tech stack:  I'm currently using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  The combination of the two let me spin up a new, reasonably clutter-free blog in very little time.  In fact, I spent more time writing that first post, rather than fiddling with a framework[1](#foot_1).

I chose this route because I like owning my data.  I always have a copy of the repository, I can check out the Jekyll runtime and run it anywhere I choose.  

Why would I do this if I'm only traveling with a tablet, you ask?  This is where the benefit of using Github comes in. I can create new files with a relatively simple file format.  The repository web view allows one to [create](https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github) and [edit](https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace) files.  Using the `_drafts` feature of Jekyll, one can edit the file (using the Github built in editor for layout previews), and then [rename it and move it](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github) to `_posts`.  Everything can be done from the browser.  

Posts are written using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format (with added bit of header information for organization, template choice etc).  Markdown's syntax is generally so clean and understandable in plain text that I've started using it in all my own notes. I'm still looking for a good android file editor - [Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamesmc.writer) looks promising - I'll also need some offline writing tools.

Granted, the quick spin up time, coupled with the fact that I'm leaving tomorrow has left the layout side of things a little plain.  In fact, it's the default template with a few minor modifications.  Heck, you can look at the [repository](https://github.com/peterschwarz/peterschwarz.github.io) itself and see what I've changed.  

Since [lightweight]({% post_url 2013-09-21-almost-packed-and-ready %}) is the name of the game right now, this stack definitely fits the bill.
