Announcing the 2.0.1 release of [clj-serial](https://github.com/peterschwarz/clj-serial)

* Converted `serial.core/open` to use keyword args
* Moved `list-ports` from `serial.core` to `serial.util`
* Added the `Bytable` protocol for extesible serialization

You'll note that this is 2.0.1, as I neglected to find a serious bug until *after* I pushed 2.0.0 to clojars.  Genius.
