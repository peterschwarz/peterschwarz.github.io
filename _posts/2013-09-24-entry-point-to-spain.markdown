Sevilla: a classic entry point to Spain.  Arriving in the early evening, too early for dinner and much too late 
for lunch, it's a good idea to sit and relax with a beer on the hostel's rooftop patio. A warm breeze goes a long
way towards refreshing the body after the hours of plane travel.

Some tapas and another round of beers at the Cervezaria Internacionales (a bar specializing in craft 
beers - something Spain has some catching up to do) did much for the body. A bit further wandering the city center left 
us sitting at a sidewalk cafe with more snacks and coffees. The plaza was busy with young people enjoying the fresh 
air and company. 

It wouldn't be a visit to Sevilla without a bit of impromptu flamenco. In this case it was a pair of couples enjoying 
some drinks one sidewalk cafe over. The men were clapping in time, as the women were dancing. No music, but 
pure enjoyment. 

Ah, Spain.
