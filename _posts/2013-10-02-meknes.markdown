Meknes, now: smaller than Fes and more laid back.  Not as much in the way of touts or hustlers, it has been quite pleasant for a couple of nights.

Damned hot and dry, but pleasant.

The only major site to see (at least, for a non-Muslim - many sites of religious significance are off limits otherwise) is the nearby ruins of [Volubilis]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis).  This city was on the western-most edge of the empire and prospered thanks to olive agriculture.  The ruin still has a number of mosaic floors in surprising condition, considering their age.

I can't quite say the same for myself after being perhaps a tad too carefree about the food has led to some upset, a bit too much sun the last two days, and a minor incident of standing up head-first into a too-short doorframe. 

Some relaxation on the riad's terrace, son crackers and a damned fine shower has me feeling far better.  Ready for the onward trip to Marrakech.
